<h1>Dri Chiu Tattersfield</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Dri, a nonbinary Taiwanese/American educator, writer and game designer. I am currently teaching high school physics near Boston, MA. I make video games, create zines and write short stories, collaboratively whenever possible. Guided by speculative fiction and magical realism, my work often plays with dissociation and memory to explore relationships to technology, bodies, time, and home. I believe in making things together to build abundant community and possibility. As a member of the Free Radicals collective, I co-create political education resources such as zines and workshops around building a more just science. I studied physics and philosophy at Claremont McKenna College.</p>
